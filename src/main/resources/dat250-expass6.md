# DAT250 - Assignment 3 Report

## Overview

For this assignment, I completed the frontend of a polling application using React.js. The application I built includes the following functionalities:
- Adding users
- Creating polls with voting options
- Voting on the created polls

I also applied CSS styling throughout the application for the user interface, and validation to ensure proper data input.

## Technical Problems Encountered

One of the main challenges I faced was implementing validation for the poll creation form. It was essential to ensure that a user is selected and at least two voting options are provided. This required careful handling of form states and conditional rendering.

## Pending Issues

**Error Handling**: Although I have implemented basic error handling, there are areas where more detailed error messages could enhance the user experience.
